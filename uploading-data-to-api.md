# Uploading Data to APIs

Whatever comes down must have gone up, as they very nearly say. That's true with our React apps. Generally, if we fetch data from an API, we will want to upload to the API.

The basic mechanics are similar. We can use `useFetch()` from `react-fetch-hook` to execute the upload. React uses JavaScript (or Typescript), making it very easy to send JSON data to an API.

The TDDers question is: how do we test it? How can we assert that our data was sent?
